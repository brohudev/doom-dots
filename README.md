## update: moving to a seperate dotfiles repo
so i just found out about gnu stow which allows me to manage all my dotfiles in one place. i will be setting it up as i add more configs to my setup and i will delete this repo once this happens. 

I also made the plunge into the deep end with vanilla emacs instead of doom (doom broke and i couldnt figure out why so vanilla emacs it is).
